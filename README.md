# BCPPUL
**Bulka's C++ Utils Library**. This is my library with useful functions.

### **Timer**: 
You can use a timer to test your code. 

The **SimpleTimer** class automatically prints the time when stopped, 
the **Timer** class simply measures the time, use the start and stop methods to measure the time. 

Also, the **stopAndPrintTime()** method stops the timer and prints the time in seconds. 

**CPUCyclesTimer** and **CPUCyclesSimpleTimer** work in a similar way, but instead of time, 
they calculate the approximate number of processor cycles.

### Math **precalculator**:
Don't use math precalculator, because it have very low performance!!!
